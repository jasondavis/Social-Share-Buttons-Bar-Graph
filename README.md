# Social Share Button Graph

This library consist of a **PHP** Back-end and a **JavaScript/HTML/CSS** Front-end to create a nice Bar Graph like the preview image below shows.

It is more then just a Bar Graph to show the Social Network Share count of a web page across the big Social Networks.

It also is a fully functional Social Network Share Script.  Each Networks Bar Graph is clickable which in turn opens a pop-up window populated with data from the web page to share on that network.

When the page loads, the Social Bar Graph animates into place and the total count combined of all Social Shares, counts up in an animated way to it's total.
